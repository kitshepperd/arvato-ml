After cloning the project please run

``poetry install``

within root directory of this repo.

Given that this dataset was not allowed to be made public please manually add the relevant .csv
files to the ``./data/`` directory

Afterwards the ``Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`` file should run fine

Please ignore the dvc files in ``./data/``. They are for my benefit only.
